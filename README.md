# TrARKSlator
An extremely simple automatic PSO2 ChatLog Translator, that's just it, whatever appears in your log NOT in english will get translated.

Heavily inspired by that one ChatLog translator from that one PSO-w thread that stopped working that one time Google Translator started requiring captcha.

Currently using Yandex Translation with my own API key, if enough people start using this it might get blocked, in that case you can always get one for free and use it instead, after recompiling source that is.

## Future
I'm considering adding Bing and maybe other "initially free" translation services as well, maybe with the option to setup your own keys/accounts and whatnot. Might add the option to select target language too.
I'm not 100% on adding much more features since I don't know how much spare time I can/am willing to spend on this, and  there are a few other similar projects already going on.
