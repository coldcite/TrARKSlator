An extremely simple automatic PSO2 ChatLog Translator, that's just it, whatever appears in your log NOT in english will get translated.  

Heavily inspired by that one ChatLog translator from that one PSO-w thread that suddenly stopped working that one time it had that one issue with Google Translator.  

Supports the following free translation services:
- Google
- Bing
- Yandex (using my own key, might get blocked once quota is reached)
- Babylon (JP only)
- FreeTranslation.com (JP only)

## Requirements 
Windows Vista _(Untested with Legacy versions)_  
.NET Framework v4.5  

## Future 
Might add a few other translation services, I'm even looking at the possibility of using local translation software.
I'm not 100% on adding more features since I don't know how much spare time I can/am willing to spend on this, and I believe there are a few other similar projects already going on, including the original.
