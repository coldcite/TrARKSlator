An extremely simple automatic PSO2 ChatLog Translator, that's just it, whatever appears in your log NOT in english will get translated.

Heavily inspired by that one ChatLog translator from that one PSO-w thread that suddenly stopped working that one time it had that one issue with Google Translator.

Currently using Google and Yandex Translation with my own API key, if enough people start using this it might get blocked, in that case you can always get one for free and use it instead, after recompiling source that is.

## Requirements
.NET Framework v4.5

## Future
Might add a few other translation services, I'm even looking at the possibility of using local translation software.
I'm not 100% on adding more features since I don't know how much spare time I can/am willing to spend on this, and I believe there are a few other similar projects already going on, including the original.

## Thanks
